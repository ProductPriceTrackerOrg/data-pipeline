```

**Note:** All JSON output files are temporary and automatically deleted after successful upload to Azure Data Lake Storage.

## 🛠️ Requirements

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install scrapy requests pillow beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv azure-storage-blob
```

### System Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- Stable internet connection
- Azure Storage Account (for data upload)

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the scraper directory:

```env
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=YOUR_ACCOUNT;AccountKey=YOUR_KEY;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
```

## � Pre-Flight Checks

**Before running the pipeline, verify your setup:**

### 1. Test Azure Connection

```bash
# Test Azure connection (if you have test files)
# python test_azure_connection.py
```

**Note:** Test files are not included in this deployment. The main scraper handles Azure connection validation automatically.

## � Quick Start

### 🎯 Primary Method: main.py Orchestrator (Recommended)

**This is the easiest and most reliable way to run the scraper:**

```bash
python main.py
```

**What happens when you run main.py:**
- ✅ **4 separate console windows** open showing real-time scraping progress
- ✅ **Parallel processing** - all 4 scripts run simultaneously for maximum speed
- ✅ **Automatic monitoring** - tracks completion and shows live status updates
- ✅ **Smart sequencing** - waits for all scrapers to finish before merging data
- ✅ **Azure upload** - automatically uploads to Azure Data Lake Storage
- ✅ **Auto-cleanup** - deletes all local JSON files after successful upload

### 📊 What You'll See

When you run `python main.py`, you'll get:

1. **Main orchestrator window** - Shows overall progress and status
2. **4 scraper windows** - Each displays real-time Scrapy output:
   - Script 1: Main categories & smartphones
   - Script 2: Accessories
   - Script 3: Major brands (Apple, Samsung, etc.)
   - Script 4: Other brands & miscellaneous

### 🔧 Alternative Methods (Not Recommended)

#### Legacy Batch Files (Deprecated)

```cmd
run_parallel_scraping.bat
```

```powershell
.\run_parallel_scraping.ps1
```

**⚠️ Note:** These legacy methods are deprecated. Use `main.py` instead for better reliability and visibility.

#### Manual Execution (For Debugging Only)

```bash
# Run individual scripts (not recommended for production)
python scripts/script1.py
python scripts/script2_accessories.py
python scripts/script3_brands.py
python scripts/script4_misc.py

# Then merge manually
python merge_json_files.py
```

### Speed Optimization Settings

```python
custom_settings = {
    "CONCURRENT_REQUESTS": 8,           # Increased for speed
    "CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN": 4, # Increased for speed
    "DOWNLOAD_DELAY": 0.25,             # Reduced for speed
    "RETRY_TIMES": 1,                   # Reduced for speed

```

### Image URL Filtering

The scraper automatically filters images to include only:

- ✅ `.webp` formats
- ✅ `.jpg` and `.jpeg` formats
- ✅ `.png` formats
- ❌ SVG placeholders
- ❌ WooCommerce placeholders
- ❌ Invalid/broken URLs

## 🧪 Testing

### Azure Connection Test

**Before running the full pipeline, test your Azure connection:**

```bash
python test_azure_connection.py
```

This test verifies:

- ✅ Azure connection string is configured
- ✅ Can connect to Azure Blob Storage
- ✅ Required `raw-data` container exists
- ✅ Has proper access permissions

**Expected Output:**

```
🎉 AZURE CONNECTION TEST PASSED!
✅ Your Azure Storage connection is working correctly.
✅ You can now run the scraping pipeline safely.
```

### Data Quality Validation

The scraper includes built-in data quality checks:

- **Image URL Format Validation**: Only WebP, JPG, PNG formats
- **Data Completeness**: Required fields validation
- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatic deduplication during merge
- **Azure Upload Verification**: Confirms successful data transfer

**Monitor data quality through:**
- Console output during scraping
- Azure Data Lake Storage verification
- Completion marker system reliability

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- `lifemobile_products_script2.json` - Accessories
- `lifemobile_products_script3.json` - Major brands
- `lifemobile_products_script4.json` - Other brands & misc

### 2. Merged Output (Temporary)

- `lifemobile_products_merged.json` - Combined & deduplicated data
- Includes statistics and metadata
- Removal of duplicate products
- Data quality enhancements

### 3. Final Storage (Permanent)

- **Azure Data Lake Storage**: `raw-data/source_website=lifemobile.lk/scrape_date=YYYY-MM-DD/data.json`
- All local JSON files are **automatically deleted** after successful upload
- Only the Azure copy remains as the single source of truth

### Data Lifecycle

```
Scraping → JSON Files → Merge → Azure Upload → Local Cleanup ✅
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### main.py Specific Issues

**"Scripts finish but merge doesn't start":**

- This is normal! main.py uses a **completion marker system** to ensure reliability
- Each script creates a `.complete` file only after fully finishing
- The merge waits for ALL 4 completion markers before starting
- Check for files: `script1.complete`, `script2.complete`, etc.

**"No console windows appear":**

- Make sure you're running `python main.py` (not clicking the file)
- Check that `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE` flag is set in main.py
- Try running from Command Prompt: `python main.py`

**"main.py exits immediately":**

- Check prerequisites: all scripts must exist in `scripts/` folder
- Verify Azure connection string in `.env` file
- Look for error messages in the console output

### Common Scraping Issues

**"403 Forbidden" Errors:**

- The site uses Cloudflare protection
- Scrapers include user agent rotation
- Built-in retry mechanisms handle temporary blocks

**"No products found":**

- Check internet connection
- Verify site accessibility
- Run individual scripts to isolate issues
- Check for site layout changes

**"Memory errors":**

- Reduce `max_products` limit in scrapers (currently set to 50)
- Run scripts individually instead of parallel
- Close other applications to free memory

**"Image URLs invalid":**

- Check the `filter_valid_image_urls()` function in scraper scripts
- Verify image accessibility manually
- Monitor console output for image processing messages

### Completion Marker System

The scraper uses a **reliable completion marker system** to prevent data corruption:

- Each script creates a marker file (e.g., `script1.complete`) ONLY after `process.start()` completes
- main.py monitors these markers every 10 seconds
- Merge/upload only begins when ALL 4 markers exist
- This prevents premature merging of incomplete JSON files

**To check completion status manually:**

```bash
dir *.complete
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging in main.py:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

Or run individual scripts with debug output:

```bash
python scripts/script1.py -L DEBUG
```

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:

- **Primary method**: Use `python main.py` for all scraping operations
- Check the **4 console windows** for real-time scraper output
- Look for **completion marker files** (`.complete`) to verify script status
- Review error logs in terminal output
- Verify network connectivity to lifemobile.lk
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check Azure connection string in `.env` file

### Quick Health Check

Verify your setup:

```bash
# Check if all required files exist
python -c "import os; files=['main.py', 'scripts/script1.py', 'scripts/script2_accessories.py', 'scripts/script3_brands.py', 'scripts/script4_misc.py', 'merge_json_files.py']; [print(f'✅ {f}') if os.path.exists(f) else print(f'❌ {f}') for f in files]"

# Test Python imports
python -c "import scrapy, azure.storage.blob, dotenv; print('✅ All dependencies available')"
```

### main.py Workflow

```
1. Run: python main.py
2. Watch 4 console windows open
3. Monitor progress in main window
4. Wait for "ALL SCRIPTS COMPLETED" message
5. Automatic merge → upload → cleanup
6. Check Azure for final data
```
